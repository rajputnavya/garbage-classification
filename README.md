# Garbage Classification using ResNet 50 (Transfer Learning)
This project is aimed to develop a garbage classification system using the ResNet50 architecture. The primary dataset serves as a foundation for building models that can eventually **automate waste segregation**, a critical step in **optimizing recycling** and **waste management**, ultimately aiding in **environmental conservation**. A notable challenge encountered is the inherent class imbalance within the dataset, prompting the exploration of data augmentation, and varied evaluation metrics. This project journey encompasses a comprehensive dataset analysis, addresses the imbalance, and delves deep into building and evaluating model through transfer learning with ResNet50.

### Objectives:
- **Dataset Exploration:** Dive into the garbage dataset, emphasizing class imbalances.
- **Tackle Imbalance:** Utilize class weights in the loss function to address dataset disparities.
- **Implement Data Augmentation:** Enhance model generalization and combat overfitting.
- **Employ Transfer Learning:** Leverage a pre-trained ResNet50, adapting it for our specific dataset.
- **Evaluate Models:** Assess model's performance using varied metrics (Learning Curves, Performance Matrix & Confusion Matrix) to ensure reliable classification.

### Inferences:
- **Accuracy: 95%**
- **Weighted Avg. F1 score : 95%**
